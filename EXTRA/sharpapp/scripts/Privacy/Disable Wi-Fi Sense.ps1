### Disable Wi-Fi Sense ### 
### Wi-Fi Sense is a feature in Windows 10 that allows you to connect to your friends shared Wi-Fi connections. That is, you and your friends may opt to share your or their Wi-Fi connections. If your computer is logged into a Microsoft account, by default it will share your Wi-Fi password with your Skype, Outlook and Facebook friends, which means your Wi-Fi password will be sent to Microsoft. ###
### You should at least stop your PC from sending your Wi-Fi password.
